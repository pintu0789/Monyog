1. Installation
===============================================================================
1.1 Redhat/Fedora systems:
--------------------------
To install MONyog on these systems the RPM package should be used.
Execute the following command as 'root' user:

# rpm -ivh <MONyog_package>.rpm

After installing, MONyog will be started automatically as a daemon/service.
You can immediately start monitoring your MySQL servers by 
pointing your browser to:
http://<YOUR_HOST>:5555 

By default, MONyog listens on port 5555. There is no default password.
Of course, the port and password are configurable.

Please refer to the section "2. Configuring MONyog in Linux" for details.

The 'service' command can be used to start/stop MONyog.
The details about how to start/stop  MONyog can be found in section:
"3. START/STOP MONyog".


1.2 Other systems (such as systems like SUSE, Ubuntu, etc):
-----------------------------------------------------------
To install MONyog on these systems the .tar.gz (tarball) package should be used.
After downloading the package, the following command can be used to extract:

$ tar -xf <MONyog_package>.tar.gz
This will extract the package contents to the directory "MONyog/".

Details about how to start/stop MONyog can be found in section:
"3. START/STOP MONyog".



===============================================================================
2. Configuring MONyog on Linux
===============================================================================
MONyog port and password are configurable through "MONyog.ini".

If MONyog was installed from the RPM package, MONyog.ini can be found in:
/usr/local/MONyog

If MONyog is extracted from the tarball (.tar.gz package), MONyog.ini 
can be found in the directory where MONyog was extracted.

The content of this file looks like:

[GENERAL]

port=5555
password=mypasswd

NOTE: MONyog should be stopped before editing this file, and restarted once
changes are saved.



===============================================================================
3. START/STOP MONyog
===============================================================================
3.1 Redhat/Fedora systems:
--------------------------
In Redhat and Fedora systems if MONyog was installed from the RPM package, 
the daemon script 'MONyogd' can be used to start/stop the server.
This script is installed in the directory "/etc/init.d/".

You can use one of the following commands to start MONyog:

# service MONyogd start
or,
# /etc/init.d/MONyogd start

Similarly, to stop MONyog:

# service MONyogd stop
or,
# /etc/init.d/MONyogd stop

To check whether MONyog is running, use:

# service MONyogd status

By default in these systems MONyog will be started automatically even 
after a system restart.


3.2 Other systems (such as systems like SUSE, Ubuntu, etc):
-----------------------------------------------------------
This section applies only if you have extracted MONyog from  the
tarball (.tar.gz package).

There is a shell script named "MONyog" in the directory "MONyog/bin".
For example if MONyog has been extracted to "~/MONyog/",
you can start MONyog by typing:

$ ~/MONyog/bin/MONyog start

Similarly, to stop:

$ ~/MONyog/bin/MONyog stop



===============================================================================
4. Upgrading to latest version of MONyog
===============================================================================
4.1 Redhat/Fedora systems:
--------------------------
If you are using the RPM package on these systems, it is very easy to upgrade to 
the latest version of MONyog. 

All you need to do, after downloading the latest RPM package, is execute the
command:

# rpm -Uvh <MONyog_package>.rpm

And you are done.


4.2 Other systems (such as systems like SUSE, Ubuntu, etc):
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you are using the tarball (.tar.gz package), stop the MONyog daemon/service.
Refer to section (3.2) for more details on how to stop MONyog.

Then extract the new tarball into the same direcory where the previous version 
of MONyog was extracted.

Start the MONyog daemon again.
